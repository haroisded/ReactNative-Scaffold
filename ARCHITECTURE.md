## The client — `src/lib/supabase.ts`

One client for every platform:

```ts
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(url, publishableKey, {
  auth: {
    storage: secureStorage,  // the iOS Keychain / the Android Keystore, never plaintext
    flowType: 'pkce',        // default is 'implicit' — this is what returns ?code=
    debug: __DEV__,          // the only instrument that reaches inside detectSessionInUrl
  },
});
```

The `<Database>` generic comes from the generated `src/lib/database.types.ts`, and it is what makes
every `.from('merchants').select()` typed end to end from the real schema — which is why no Zod
schema mirrors a migration anywhere in this project ([instruction_mds/data-layer.md §4](./instruction_mds/data-layer.md)).
Regenerate it whenever a migration lands.

Three options, and every one of them does work. `storage` is load-bearing twice over: without it
the client falls back to an in-memory adapter and the session dies with the process, and what it
points at decides whether the refresh token sits in plaintext.

### What is deliberately not here

It matters as much, because current tutorials all add it:

- **No `persistSession` / `autoRefreshToken`.** Both are already the defaults.
- **No `detectSessionInUrl`.** The library gates it on `isBrowser()`, which is
  `typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof document !== 'undefined'`. React Native has no
  `document`, so the option is already inert here whatever it is set to. `browserOAuth` in
  `auth.ts` does the exchange by hand instead.
- **No `lock: processLock`.** It is `@deprecated` in 2.112.3 and the legacy lock path is removed
  in v3. The client single-flights refreshes itself now and lets the GoTrue server resolve
  cross-tab races; setting it opts back into the old path.
- **No `react-native-url-polyfill`.** Every `new URL(...)` in `auth-js` reads
  `window.location.href` behind an `isBrowser()` guard, so native never reaches one.

### The `AppState` listener

An `AppState` listener starts and stops the refresh timer. That is not redundant with
`autoRefreshToken` — on a non-browser platform the library's refresh loop otherwise runs
*continuously in the background*.

---

## Session storage — `src/lib/secure-storage.ts`

Three methods — `getItem`, `setItem`, `removeItem` — which is the whole of `SupportedStorage`.
All three call `expo-secure-store`, on every platform this app runs on.

**Why not AsyncStorage on native.** It is not encrypted: an ordinary SQLite row on Android, an
ordinary file in the app container on iOS. Filesystem access on a rooted or jailbroken device, or
an unencrypted device backup, yields the refresh token — and that alone mints access tokens until
someone revokes it. SecureStore puts the same string behind the iOS Keychain and the Android
Keystore.

**`keychainAccessible: AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`**, not the `WHEN_UNLOCKED` default, under which any read
while the device is locked fails outright. The `AppState` listener above already stops refreshing
in the background, so this deletes a failure mode rather than depending on that ordering holding.
The item still never leaves the device: `expo-secure-store` never sets `kSecAttrSynchronizable`, so
iCloud Keychain does not carry it.

**No chunking**, which other scaffolds add to stay under a 2048-byte limit. That limit belonged to
the RSA hybrid encryptor, kept only as a read path for Android API 22 and below — beneath SDK 57's
floor. The live write path is AES into SharedPreferences, and `setItemAsync` checks only that the
value is a string. Splitting a session across keys now buys nothing and adds a torn-write window.

Keys need no escaping either: SecureStore validates them against `/^[\w.-]+$/`, and every key
`auth-js` writes is the storage key plus a suffix — `-user`, `-code-verifier`,
`-flows-code-verifier`, `-flow-<32 hex>-code-verifier`.

---

## The session store — `src/Store/StoreUser.ts`

A single `onAuthStateChange` subscription, subscribed at module scope, is the source of truth. It
fires with `INITIAL_SESSION` (restored from storage) shortly after subscribing, so no separate
`getSession()` call is needed — a second source could disagree with the first.

The session has **three** states, not two:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `undefined` | until the first event arrives |
| `null` | once resolved and signed out |
| `Session` | once signed in |

`isLoading` is derived (`session === undefined`), never stored, so the two cannot desync.

---

## The route guard — `src/app/_layout.tsx`

`PaperProvider` over two mutually exclusive route states:

```tsx
<Stack.Protected guard={!session}><Stack.Screen name="sign-in" /></Stack.Protected>
<Stack.Protected guard={!!session}><Stack.Screen name="(app)" /></Stack.Protected>
```

**No router call ever crosses that boundary.** Sign-in and sign-out only change the session, and the
guards move the user; there is no `router.replace` to a signed-in route anywhere. Ordinary
navigation *inside* the signed-in tree is normal — tapping a SystemCard pushes `systems/[id]`, the
app bar navigates to the account tab — but nothing navigates its way past the guard. The layout
renders `null` while the session is unknown, so the splash screen covers the restore and the sign-in
screen never flashes.

Under the `(app)` guard the tree splits once more: `(tabs)` owns the four bottom-bar destinations,
and `systems/[id]` sits beside it rather than inside it, so opening a system pushes *over* the bar
instead of becoming a fifth tab.

`systems/[id]` is the merchant shell: one expo-router `Drawer`, a permanent rail on a wide container
and an off-canvas drawer on a narrow one, around eight destinations. Back retraces visited
destinations (`backBehavior="history"`), and leaving one pops its stack to its list
(`popToTopOnBlur`). Every destination stack anchors on its list (`unstable_settings.anchor`), so a
push from another destination — Inventory's **Selling as**, the Register's **View receipt** — passes
`withAnchor: true` and Back lands on that list rather than on Home. `profile` sits beside it as
well, so Profile opened from inside a system pushes over the shell and back returns there; its
**Back to your systems** button is `router.dismissTo('/')`. `(app)/_layout.tsx` anchors the stack on
`(tabs)`, so a deep link into a system still has the systems list underneath. Signing
out or deleting the account from that Profile is the same guard flip as anywhere else — the whole
`(app)` history goes, with no router call.

The guard is **UX, not security** — expo-router evaluates it client-side only, and the signed-in
bundle is on the device either way. Supabase RLS is the real boundary, which is what the policies
under [The database](#the-database--supabase) are for.

---

## Sign-in paths — `src/lib/auth.ts`

| Provider | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Google | native sheet → `signInWithIdToken` |
| Facebook | system browser → `exchangeCodeForSession` |

The Google path never opens a browser, never uses `redirectTo`, and never touches PKCE — so if
Google sign-in fails, no redirect configuration can be the cause.

The browser path uses `WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync`, which watches for `redirectTo` as a
prefix and closes the browser the moment a navigation matches, then parses the returned deep link
with `Linking.parse`.

`signOut` uses `scope: 'local'`. The default `'global'` ends the session on every device the user
is signed in on, and it is a server call, so it throws when offline — stranding someone signed in.
It also clears the native Google session, which Supabase leaves cached; without that the next
sign-in silently reuses the last account instead of showing the picker.

`deleteAccount` calls the `delete_current_user` RPC and then `signOut`. The deletion has to happen
in Postgres because no client-side key may write to `auth.users` — see
[The database](#the-database--supabase).

---

## How a cancel reaches the app

It arrives two different ways, and both are handled.

- **Cancel *inside* the provider's dialog** is a normal redirect back through Supabase carrying
  `error=access_denied` — the prefix matches, so the browser closes and reports success. Reading
  `error_description` there would put Facebook's literal "Permissions error" on screen for someone
  who just changed their mind, so `browserOAuth` checks for `access_denied` first and resolves
  `'cancelled'` quietly.
- **Dismissing the browser *itself*** is the other path, and it is not redundant: on Android a
  genuine user cancel arrives that way too, which is also why it only logs a warning rather than
  throwing — a Supabase allow-list miss is indistinguishable from a dismiss at that point.

---

## The database — `supabase/`

`public.profiles`, the person; `public.merchants`, the tenant; the product catalogue, the first
business tables (below); plus the event trigger that would auto-enable RLS (not installable on the hosted project — see below), and one
migration that only drops leftovers from an unrelated
project.

`public.profiles` has `id` referencing `auth.users` with `on delete cascade`, `display_name`,
`avatar_url`, `created_at` — plus its policies, a trigger that fills the row on signup, and the
function behind the **Delete account** button.

There is no `email` column. `auth.users.email` is the source of truth and the client already holds
it as `session.user.email`; a copy would go stale on the first address change and need a second
trigger to keep in step.

### `public.merchants` — the tenant

`owner_id` referencing `auth.users` with `on delete cascade`, `name`, `description`, a
`public.store_category` enum, `created_at`, and length checks on the two text columns. The cascade
is what lets `delete_current_user()` stay one statement: deleting the `auth.users` row takes the
profile and every merchant with it.

**A merchant is a business, not a person**, and each one is what the UI calls a "system" — the cards
on the home screen are this table. Today a merchant has exactly one user and `owner_id` *is* the
membership; `merchant_members` and roles are still ahead, and the shape they take is in
[instruction_mds/tenancy.md](./instruction_mds/tenancy.md).

`category` is a Postgres enum rather than `text` + a check constraint, because the enum generates a
real union in `database.types.ts`. That union is what lets `CATEGORY_META[row.category]` compile with
no type assertion — and `.oxlintrc.json` rejects assertions. Adding a value later is
`alter type … add value` **in a migration of its own**: Postgres will not let the same transaction
use a value it just added.

Its four policies key on `owner_id`, not on `current_merchant_ids()` below, and that is deliberate.
The rule against `auth.uid() = row.user_id` governs *business* tables — the ones carrying a
`merchant_id`. This is the tenant root itself, and routing its policies through the function that
reads the tenant root is a self-reference. When `merchant_members` lands, only the select policy
changes.

Unlike `profiles`, it has a delete policy: removing one of your own businesses is an ordinary
action, not account deletion.

### `private.current_merchant_ids()` — the seam

`security definer`, `stable`, returning the merchant ids the caller owns. Its first callers are the
product catalogue's policies, and `authenticated` holds `usage` on `private` and `execute` on it for
exactly that reason ([instruction_mds/tenancy.md §3](./instruction_mds/tenancy.md)).
It was written before any caller on purpose: every business table gets policies shaped
`using (merchant_id in (select private.current_merchant_ids()))`, and staff support then arrives by
rewriting this one function body — no policy rewrites, no table alterations. Writing it now is what
stops the first business table shipping an `auth.uid() = owner_id` policy "just for now" that then
has to be undone on every table.

### The policies

Scoped `to authenticated`, so they are never evaluated for `anon` at all. Every `auth.uid()` is
wrapped as `(select auth.uid())` — unwrapped it runs once per row scanned, wrapped the planner runs
it once as an InitPlan. `profiles_update_own` carries both `using` and `with check`: `using`
decides which rows may be updated, `with check` what they may be updated *to*, and without the
second a user could hand their row to somebody else by rewriting its `id`.

No delete policy — the row goes when the account does, through the cascade.

The table is deliberately **not** `force row level security`. Forcing it subjects the table owner
to the policies too, and the signup trigger inserts as the owner at a moment when there is no JWT,
so `auth.uid()` is null and `profiles_insert_own` would reject the row signup exists to create.

### The `security definer` functions

`private.handle_new_user()` creates the profile row on signup, reading `full_name` and `avatar_url`
out of `raw_user_meta_data` where both providers land them. `public.delete_current_user()` deletes
the caller's own `auth.users` row, which cascades. `private.current_merchant_ids()` is the third,
described above.

`security definer` means the body runs with the *owner's* privileges, not the caller's — a
deliberate privilege escalation, which is why all three of these are mandatory every time:

| | Stops |
| --- | --- |
| `private` schema, or `revoke execute` | The function being called over PostgREST at `/rest/v1/rpc/<name>` by anyone holding the publishable key |
| `set search_path = ''` + a fully-qualified body | The caller pointing an unqualified name at their own object and having it run as the owner |
| A `(select auth.uid())` check inside the body | The function doing anything for a caller beyond their own rows |

The revokes name `public, anon, authenticated, service_role` individually rather than just `PUBLIC`
because Supabase ships default privileges that grant `EXECUTE` on new functions in `public` to the
last three **directly**. Revoking from `PUBLIC` alone leaves three live grants behind.

Revoking `EXECUTE` does not break the signup trigger: Postgres checks that privilege when a trigger
is *created*, not each time it fires.

### RLS is per-table, and still written by hand

`alter table … enable row level security` is set explicitly for `profiles` and again for
`merchants`, and every migration added later must carry that line for its own tables. A new table in `public` is served over HTTP by
PostgREST the moment it exists. The dashboard's Security Advisor reports the ones missing it under
`rls_disabled_in_public`.

`20260902000003_rls_auto_enable.sql` was meant as a second line of defence: a DDL event trigger,
`ensure_rls`, that enables RLS on every table subsequently created in `public`. It does not replace
the explicit line, for two reasons its header spells out.

Creating an event trigger needs superuser, and the `DO` block around it warns and continues instead
of failing. On this project's hosted database that is not a risk but the outcome: the hosted
`postgres` role is not a superuser, `create event trigger` fails with `permission denied`, and the
trigger is **not installed** (verified 2026-09-13). `private.rls_auto_enable()` exists with nothing
calling it; the trigger works only on a local `supabase start` stack.

And it is invisible: `\d` does not mention it, the table's own migration does not mention it, and an
unexpectedly empty query result leads nowhere near it.

The function behind it lives in `private` and is revoked from `public, anon, authenticated,
service_role`, for the reasons in the section above.

### The product catalogue — `20260914092147_products.sql`

The first business tables: `product_categories` (two levels, through `parent_id`), `tax_classes`,
`suppliers`, `products`, and a product's six child sets — rate tiers, operating hours, variant
attributes, variants, components and custom fields. Every one has a `not null merchant_id`, its own
`enable row level security` line, and four `*_own_merchant` policies calling
`current_merchant_ids()`.

- **Composite foreign keys.** Each parent carries `unique (id, merchant_id)` and every reference is
  `(x_id, merchant_id)`, so a product cannot point at another merchant's category, tax class or
  supplier, and a child row cannot hang off another merchant's product. The key enforces it, not a
  policy.
- **`public.save_product(payload jsonb)`** — `security invoker`, so RLS still gates every statement
  inside it. One transaction writes the product row and replaces its child sets; the product form
  saves through it. Delete-and-reinsert gives the children new ids on every save, which is fine until
  an order references a variant — switch to keyed upserts then.
- **`private.assert_no_bundle_cycle()`** — a trigger on `product_components` that walks the component
  graph and refuses a row that would make a bundle contain itself (`23514`,
  `product_components_cycle`). A product still used as a component cannot be deleted (`23503`). The
  screens turn both codes into copy.
- **`is_low_stock`** — a stored generated column, because PostgREST cannot compare two columns in a
  filter.
- **`products_price_when_sold`** — a product sold on its own needs a selling price once it leaves
  draft.
- **`merchants.currency`** — ISO 4217, default `PHP`. Prices render through `src/lib/money.ts`.

### Suppliers, inventory items and the stock ledger — `20260928100000`, `20260928100300`, `20260929100000`, `20260929100100`, `20260930100000`

What these follow is `.claude/inventory-stock/` — the two mockups (`Inventory.html`,
`Stock_Receiving.html`), the tier list and `instructions.txt`.

- **Codes.** `private.merchant_counters` holds one counter per merchant and kind, and
  `private.issue_code()` turns the next value into a padded code, skipping any code a merchant has
  already typed. Suppliers (`SUP-0001`) and stock SKUs (`SKU-00001`) get theirs from the
  `private.assign_code()` trigger when the column is left blank or empty. Receipts, lots, cases and
  packs (`RC-`, `LOT-YYYYMMDD-`, `CS-`, `PK-`) get theirs inside the ledger's writers. A committed code
  is never issued again.
- **`suppliers`** gains a profile, terms, `supplier_types` (a per-merchant lookup) and `active`. A
  supplier with receipts can only be deactivated, and only an active one can be picked on a receipt.
- **Three layers for one sellable thing.** An **Inventory item** is a `products` row with
  `type = 'stock'`: the master record — name, SKU (required), pack and base unit names, `sell_by`,
  `stock_role` (Sellable / Component / Both), a `product_groups` parent and `attributes`, category.
  `conversion_factor` means base units per pack and `perishable` means "has expiry". Its **Products
  faces** are `flat` drafts, one per Sell By unit, linked through `source_item_id` and a one-unit
  `product_components` row; they carry price, tax and recipe, because a pack and a tablet are priced
  apart. The **packs** are the physical stock (below).
- **Faces follow the item.** `private.sync_register_faces` runs after an item's role, Sell By or status
  changes and calls `public.ensure_register_faces()`: a wanted unit without a face gets a draft; an
  unwanted draft is deleted, an unwanted published face archived, and a wanted archived face restored
  as a draft. So the Inventory list's inline Type menu is a plain `update`. Products → **Add from
  Inventory** calls the same function to bring back a face someone deleted.
- **`save_stock_item()`** (security invoker) is the Inventory form's writer: the item, a new group,
  and optional stock on hand, in one transaction.
- **A variant group owns its category** (`20261001110000_group_category.sql`). `product_groups` carries
  `category_id` / `subcategory_id`; the first categorised item saved into a group gives it one, and from
  then on `private.group_category_to_item` overwrites a member's category with the group's, and
  `private.group_category_to_items` moves every member when the group's changes. So a group is one folder
  under one category, and queries filtering items by category need no join.
- **The ledger.** `stock_receipts` (supplier optional; `received_on` falls back to today) →
  `stock_lots` (one per receipt line, or per Inventory add with `source = 'inventory'` and no receipt;
  the Unit Load, Pallet and Case tiers it came in; lot number, null when left blank; expiry;
  `packs_expected` beside `packs_received`, and `units_per_pack_received`, which is recorded only;
  `unit_cost` as typed, else line cost ÷ base units) → `stock_cases` → `stock_packs`, **one row per
  physical pack**, each with its own `qty_remaining` and optional manufacturer serial. Sealed, open and
  empty are derived. Loose units received are one partial pack. `stock_movements` is the append-only
  history, one row per pack touched. Clients can only read these five tables; every write goes through
  `save_receipt`, `add_inventory_stock`, `draw_stock`, `record_stock_movement` or `void_receipt`, each
  security definer, granted to `authenticated`, opening with `private.assert_member()`.
- **The pick order** lives in one place, the `stock_pick_queue` view: open packs first, then closest
  expiry, fewest left, oldest lot, pack code; expired packs are never picked. `pick_rank` orders a
  loose-unit draw and `whole_rank` a sale by the pack. The Inventory screens mark its first row
  **Next pick**, and `draw_stock(product_id, qty, mode, kind)` — for the Register (`sale`) and recipes
  (`consume`) — walks it, opening sealed packs and spilling across packs and cases, or refuses the whole
  draw with `insufficient_stock`.
- **Shipping cost is not spread.** `save_receipt` keeps `stock_receipts.freight` on the receipt and
  writes `freight_share = 0` on every lot since `20260930100000_receipt_inputs.sql`; a lot saved before
  it keeps its share. Rejected: spreading by line value — a typed cost per base unit is final.
- **`qty_on_hand` and `cost_price` on a stock item are derived.** `private.recompute_stock()` sets them
  from the packs: the quantity sums them in base units, and the cost is their weighted landed cost.
  The `products_guard_stock` trigger keeps a client role from writing either, and refuses archiving or
  a new units-per-pack while stock is on hand. An item with stock history cannot be deleted.
- **`stock_lot_lines`** is a lot with what it has left (from its packs): the Stock screen's rows.

## Frontend wiring

The UI rules themselves are in [CLAUDE.md §3](./CLAUDE.md#3-the-ui). What follows is only how the
tree is put together.

`src/themes.js` holds the two MD3 palettes and reaches every screen through `PaperProvider`, so a
color is read from the theme rather than written at a call site. The handful of places a color is
chosen by hand are all destructive or category actions reading `useAppTheme().colors.error` /
`onError` — **Delete account** and **Sign Out** in `src/screens/profile/index.tsx`, and **Remove**
on `src/screens/home/system-card.tsx` — plus the merchant shell, whose header and rail sit on
`primary` and mark the active item with `accent`, and the native views (`NativeTabs`, sheets,
`Pressable` ripples), which take every colour as a prop because `PaperProvider` does not reach them.

The shell (`src/app/(app)/systems/[id]/_layout.tsx`) hands three things to every destination through
context, because the screens under it are routes and receive no props from it:
`ShellWideContext` (`src/lib/columns.ts`) — the one wide/narrow decision, measured on the shell's
root; `ShellMerchantContext` (`src/features/merchants/queries.ts`) — the system being shown, since the
rail navigates with no params and a destination's own params carry no id; and
`UnsavedGuardContext` (`src/lib/unsaved-guard.ts`) — a ref a screen with unsaved changes fills, which
the rail asks before switching destination, because a drawer switch removes nothing for
`usePreventRemove` to catch.

### Stock and Inventory

**Stock** (`systems/[id]/stock/`) holds Suppliers and Receipts. The Receipts pane lists one row per
receipt line — remaining against received — opening onto its cases and packs. A receipt is written once
by the seven-step `receipt-wizard` (Supplier, Unit Load, Pallet, Case, Pack, Base Unit, Review; the tiers
can be skipped, and Base Unit only shows while something sells by the base unit). The Pack step's
**Restock item** switch picks an existing item, which is then required; off, the line names a new item,
optionally a variant (`src/components/variant-fields.tsx`, shared with the item form). A line's stock is its
received packs, or its expected packs when received is left blank and read back by
`receipt-detail`, where it can be voided while nothing has been drawn from it. **Inventory** is
`product-list` in the `inventory` scope, browsed as folders — category, subcategory, variant group
(`src/features/products/folders.ts`, `src/components/folder-nav.tsx`); each folder is the list route pushed
with `category` / `sub` / `group` params, so Back climbs one, and a search lists every match flat. Stock's
Receipts pane folds its lines the same way. Filters other than search and sort sit in a panel
(`list-filters-dialog.tsx`, `sheets/list-filters`) whose state is `src/Store/list-filters.ts`, shared by
every folder level. Rows from `inventory-rows.tsx` show the count in base units,
packs and open packs, cost and value, an inline Type menu, and open onto a lot-and-pack drill
(`src/components/lot-drill.tsx`, `pack-row.tsx`) with the next pick marked. Opening an item on a
tablet puts `inventory-detail` beside the list; on a phone it is its own route. The detail's pack rows
adjust, write off and return through `record_stock_movement` — the full-page `forms/stock-movement`
at every width. The Inventory item form (`stock-item-form`) is a `section-stepper` mirroring the receipt's
Pack step: Pack (details, stock settings, and a new item's optional quantity on hand), Variant, Base unit (only
when Sell by is not Pack), Review. A picked group's category shows in Pack, locked. **Products** gains **Add from Inventory**
(`add-from-inventory-dialog.tsx`, `sheets/add-from-inventory`). Rentables is off the rail for now; its
routes stay. The server's refusals come back as snake_case messages, which `stockFailure()`
(`src/features/stock-receipts/queries.ts`) reads so a screen can show its own copy.

### Register and Receipts

**Register** (`systems/[id]/register.tsx`, `src/screens/register/`) sells what the Products screen
publishes — flat, active, sold directly — and nothing from Inventory or Rentables. Cash only; prices
include tax. Wide shows the items pane (`ITEM_PANE`) beside the cart; narrow switches Items | Cart,
with the payment at the foot of the Cart tab. The cart, the cash typed and the idempotency key live in
`Register` above both panes. One `record_sale` call (`20260930110000_sales.sql`) writes the sale, its
lines and every stock draw — a face draws its item through `draw_stock` (`sale`), a recipe draws its
components (`consume`), a plain product draws nothing — or refuses the lot; every movement carries the
sale's `SL-` code as `ref`. A retried `client_key` returns the sale already made.

**Receipts** (`systems/[id]/receipts/`, a rail destination, not Stock's Receipts pane) lists sales
newest first (`src/screens/sales/`); `sale-detail` shows the lines, the payment, and **Stock drawn** —
the movements with the sale's code. `void_sale` puts every unit back on the pack it came from as a
`void` movement and marks the sale Void; it refuses a sale already void, and a pack that cannot take
its units back. Sales and their lines are select-only for clients.

### The data layer

`src/lib/query.ts` builds the `QueryClient` (`retry: false`, `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`) and, at
module scope, wires the two managers React Native has no events for: `onlineManager` from
`expo-network`, and `focusManager` from `AppState`. That `AppState` listener is **not** the one in
`supabase.ts` — this one reports foreground to React Query, that one starts and stops token refresh.
Both exist.

`src/app/_layout.tsx` mounts `QueryProvider` **keyed on `session?.user.id`**. The key is the whole
point: switching accounts remounts the provider, which builds a new client and drops the old cache.
RLS does not help here — cached rows are already on the device and render before any request goes
out.

Feature folders are keyed on the **resource**, never on the page or screen that happens to use them
([instruction_mds/structure.md §3](./instruction_mds/structure.md)). `src/features/merchants/queries.ts` is the only file
in the app that knows the table is called `merchants`.

Paper's icons go through `PaperProvider`'s `settings` prop in `src/app/_layout.tsx` to
`renderIcon` (`src/lib/icons.tsx`), which draws each app icon name as the platform's own symbol with
`expo-symbols` and falls back to MaterialCommunityIcons for Paper's internal names and the brand logos.
Paper's own default goes through `react-native-vector-icons`, whose font files nothing here loads, so
icons would render as blank boxes. `react-native-vector-icons` stays in `package.json` because Paper
imports it internally regardless of the override.
