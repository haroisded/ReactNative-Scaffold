-- Enables RLS automatically on every table created in `public` from here on.
--
-- This runs. It is a normal migration and `supabase db push` applies it.
--
--
-- What it does
--
-- Installs a DDL event trigger that runs `alter table ... enable row level security` on every table
-- created in `public` from then on. Forgetting that on one table is the most common way a Supabase
-- project leaks data: PostgREST publishes the table over HTTP the moment it exists, the publishable
-- key ships inside the app bundle where anyone can read it out, and with no policy in force every
-- row is world-readable.
--
--
-- It is a safety net, not the mechanism
--
-- Keep writing `alter table ... enable row level security` explicitly in every migration. Two
-- reasons this trigger cannot be relied on alone:
--
--   1. It needs superuser to install (see the DO block at the bottom), and a hosted project's
--      migration role may not have it. The block warns and continues rather than failing the push,
--      so the trigger may quietly not be there at all.
--   2. It is invisible. `\d your_table` does not mention it, the migration that created that table
--      does not mention it, and nothing leads a reader from an unexpectedly empty result back to
--      this file.
--
-- RLS with no policies is deny-all, so when it does fire the failure mode is a query returning
-- nothing — loud, and one `create policy` away from fixed.
--
--
-- What still reports the gap
--
-- The dashboard's Security Advisor (Advisors -> Security) reports `rls_disabled_in_public` for any
-- table this missed. `supabase db lint` is NOT this — that command only type-checks plpgsql.

create schema if not exists private;

-- The function lives in `private`, not `public`. PostgREST only publishes `public` (and
-- `graphql_public`), so nothing in here has a /rest/v1/rpc/ URL at all. The revoke below is a
-- second lock on the same door.
create or replace function private.rls_auto_enable()
returns event_trigger

security definer
-- Pinned, and the body fully qualified because of it. An unqualified name inside a security
-- definer function resolves against the *caller's* search_path, so a caller who creates their own
-- `format` or their own table and points the path at it gets that object executed with this
-- function's owner privileges. Empty is safe for the calls below: pg_catalog is searched
-- implicitly even when it is not on the path.
