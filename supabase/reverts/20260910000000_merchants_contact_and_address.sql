-- Reverts 20260910000000_merchants_contact_and_address.sql.
--
-- DESTROYS DATA: every merchant's contact_email and phone go with their columns. address is renamed
-- back to description, so what it holds survives.
--
-- The app expects the new shape — src/features/merchants/schema.ts and src/lib/database.types.ts
-- name all three columns — so regenerate the types after running this.
--
-- Newest revert, so nothing has to run before it. supabase/all-in-one/revert.sql orders every revert
-- newest first (instruction_mds/migrations.md).

-- Dropping a column takes its check constraint with it. Named anyway, so this file reads as the exact
-- inverse of the one it undoes.

-- Guarded by a catalog lookup for the same reason the forward rename is: ALTER ... RENAME COLUMN
-- accepts no `if exists`.
