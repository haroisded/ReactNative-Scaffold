# Context policy

How an agent gets context in this repo, and what it is not allowed to read to get it. This file
exists to keep a pass cheap: context is fetched on demand from queryable sources, never by reading
history documents.

## Rules

1. **History comes from git, not from markdown.** `git log`, `git show`, `git diff` are the history
   record. Do not write, read or maintain per-pass history files. When a page or feature is
   finished, the agent writes the commit message and asks; the human commits (§2).
2. **System context comes from one file plus the graph.** Read `.claude/context/system-context.txt`
   for the summary. For anything more specific, query the knowledge graph — never `grep`/`find` your
   way across the repo to orient.
3. **The graph updates itself.** `graphify hook install` (one-time, human's terminal) fires
   `graphify update .` automatically on every commit. Nothing to run mid-pass, nothing for the agent
   to remember.
4. **Read the Rules block of an `instruction_mds/` file, not the whole file.** Read a numbered
   section only when overriding the rule it explains, or when the rule points at it by number.
5. **Load a skill only when its trigger applies** ([`expo.md`](./expo.md) rule 1). Do not load a
   skill to confirm a rule an `instruction_mds/` file already states. Token cost of tools, skills and
   retrieval is [`token-budget.md`](./token-budget.md).
6. **Do not open `.claude/context/Documentations-for-AI-Agents/` unless a rule names the file.**
   Those are reference volumes, not reading material.
7. **`/clear` between tasks, `/compact` mid-task.** Long context costs more per turn even when
   cached.
8. **Be deliberate about subagents.** Each one runs its own requests. Configure a cheaper model for
   simple subagents in the agent's frontmatter.

## 1. Where context lives

| Question | Source |
| --- | --- |
| What changed, when, and why | `git log` / `git show` |
| What this system is, end to end | `.claude/context/system-context.txt` |
| Where a thing is implemented, what calls what | `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify explain "<node>"`, `graphify affected "<node>"` |
| What was decided about a convention | the `instruction_mds/` file that owns it |
| What a mockup draws | `.claude/context/UI Reference/` — read-only |
| What a tool's finding means here | [`false-positives.md`](./false-positives.md) |

Nothing else is a context source. If an answer is not in one of these, it is not written down, and
writing it down means updating the owning `instruction_mds/` file — not creating a new document.

## 2. Commit as the history record

A finished page or feature ends in one commit, scoped to that page or feature. The commit message
carries what a history file used to. This replaces per-pass history markdown entirely — do not
recreate it under another name.

**One page or feature, one message file, always.** Two finished in the same session are still two
files and two commits — never one message covering both, and never a second page appended to a file
already written. The session is not the unit; the page or feature is. Where that means staging by
hand, the agent says which files belong to which commit rather than merging them.

### When to prompt

When a page or feature **the user asked for** is finished *and*
[`testing-workflow.md`](./testing-workflow.md) §1 has passed, the agent writes the message and asks
the human to commit it. Not on a partial change, not between two halves of one feature, not after a
check that is still failing.

### How

The agent **never runs a git write** — no `commit`, no `branch`, no `push` — unless the human asks
for that commit in the same session. Then it writes the file below and runs the `git commit -F` line
itself; still no branch and no push. Otherwise it:

1. writes the message to `.claude/commit-history/<timestamp>.txt`, where `<timestamp>` is the
   current local date and time as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` — `2026-09-19_14-32-08.txt`. Sortable, and
   nothing is ever overwritten. Seconds are in the name because two features can finish inside the
   same minute and each still gets its own file.
2. prints the message in the reply so it can be read without opening anything,
3. gives the human the one line that uses it:

```bash
git commit -F ".claude/commit-history/<timestamp>.txt"
```

That folder is a **handoff, not a history**. It is gitignored, the agent writes into it and never
reads it back to orient, and rule 1 is unchanged: `git log` remains the record. Keeping the file out
of the commit is what stops it becoming a second, quietly diverging one.

`-F` is not optional. `git commit` opened in an editor runs cleanup `strip`, which deletes every
line beginning with `#` — the whole body below would vanish. `-F` and `-m` run cleanup `whitespace`,
which keeps them.

### The message

```
<Session Title>

# What were the Changes?

## Added
- …

## Removed
- …

## Edited
- …

# Additional Notes

## <a category this change needs>
- …
```

- **The title line carries no `#`.** It is what `git log --oneline` shows, so it reads as a sentence
  and stays under about 72 characters. It summarises the session, not the last file touched.
- **`Added`, `Removed` and `Edited` are always all three present.** An empty one reads `- none`. A
  reader can then tell "nothing was removed" from "nobody checked".
- **`# Additional Notes` is optional, and its sub-headings are invented per commit** — whatever this
  change needs a reader to know that `Added` / `Removed` / `Edited` cannot say. Something deliberately
  left out, a device test still owed, a decision that will be revisited. Omit the whole section when
  there is nothing.
- **Every bullet names a file or a thing the user can see**, not a diff. `src/lib/auth.ts` or
  "the Next button now clears the navigation bar" — never "refactored the auth module".

## 3. graphify

Claude's default way to answer "how does X work" is to grep for strings and read whole files to
orient, which burns thousands of tokens before the first useful sentence. The graph answers the same
question from an index — tool: [`graphify`](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify), tree-sitter
AST parsing.

**One-time setup, run by the human, not the agent:**

```bash
uv tool install graphifyy          # or: pipx install graphifyy
graphify claude install            # writes a CLAUDE.md section + a PreToolUse hook that
                                    # nudges Claude to check the graph before Glob/Grep
graphify update .                  # builds the graph — AST only, no LLM, no token cost
graphify hook install              # post-commit + post-checkout hooks — keeps it in sync
                                    # automatically from here on
```

`graphify extract .` is the alternative first-build command — same AST pass plus an LLM backend for
semantic community naming. It costs tokens against whichever backend it's pointed at
(`--backend gemini|kimi|claude|openai|deepseek|ollama`). Use `update`, not `extract`, unless the
richer labeling is worth that cost — `update` is the default for this repo.

**What the agent runs, every pass** — all read-only, all against the existing `graph.json`:

| Command | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `graphify query "<question>" --budget 2000` | The general case — BFS traversal, capped at 2000 tokens by default. Lower `--budget` for a narrow question |
| `graphify explain "<node>"` | One symbol and its immediate neighbors, plain language |
| `graphify affected "<node>"` | Reverse traversal — what a change to this node touches. Run this instead of guessing scope by hand ([`testing-workflow.md`](./testing-workflow.md) rule 6) |
| `graphify god-nodes` | The most-connected nodes — a fast first orientation on an unfamiliar area, cheaper than `query` with a vague question |

**Never build or update the graph itself.** `graphify hook install` means it is never stale by more
than one commit, with zero agent-side steps. If the hook is not installed on a given machine, say so
and ask the human to run it — do not run `graphify update` as a workaround, and never call
`graphify extract` on the agent's own initiative — that spends real LLM tokens against a backend the
agent did not choose.

## 4. Reading `instruction_mds/`

Every file in `instruction_mds/` is Rules first, then numbered sections.

- **Default:** read the Rules block. It is the instruction.
- **Read a section** when following the rule requires the detail it holds (a constant, a code shape,
  a command) or when you intend to override the rule.
- **Never read a whole `instruction_mds/` file to "get context".** That is what §1 is for.

| File | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| [`structure.md`](./structure.md) | Which directories exist, what goes in each |
| [`data-layer.md`](./data-layer.md) | Supabase calls, Zod, TanStack Query |
| [`layout.md`](./layout.md) | Widths, columns, spacing, the wide/narrow threshold |
| [`typography.md`](./typography.md) | The nine text variants |
| [`visual-language.md`](./visual-language.md) | Colour, corners, icons, Paper piece per pattern |
| [`expo.md`](./expo.md) | The skill gate, SDK pinning, skill overrides |
| [`tenancy.md`](./tenancy.md) | `merchant_id`, RLS policy shape |
| [`migrations.md`](./migrations.md) | Migration and revert pairing |
| [`testing-workflow.md`](./testing-workflow.md) | Before/after code; the agent never touches the device |
| [`acceptance-tests.md`](./acceptance-tests.md) | How `.claude/tests/<feature>.md` is written for human testers |
| [`optimization.md`](./optimization.md) | Performance review and the one skill gate table |
| [`token-budget.md`](./token-budget.md) | Wrapped tool output, narrow skill triggers, bounded retrieval |
| [`false-positives.md`](./false-positives.md) | Tool findings that are wrong here |
| [`context-policy.md`](./context-policy.md) | This file |

## 5. Skills

98 skills are installed and their descriptions cost tokens in every turn. Two rules follow:

- **Prune what this repo does not use.** A skill that has never been loaded on this project is cost
  with no return. Review the list periodically with `/context`.
- **Load a skill for its trigger, not for reassurance.** The `instruction_mds/` files already state
  this repo's decisions; a skill read that only confirms one is wasted. Where a skill contradicts a
  doc, the doc wins and the contradiction is registered, never fixed in code.

Heavy skills can be scoped down or pinned to a cheaper model in their frontmatter. Skills that overlap
on the same diff get narrower descriptions, never a merge — [`token-budget.md`](./token-budget.md) §2.

## 6. Not used here

**No `System-Context/` directory, no per-page history markdown, no `Tests.md` in a page directory,
no index file listing where code lives.** Git, the graph and the single system-context file replace
all of them. The one exception is `.claude/tests/<feature>.md`: it is written for human testers,
not as agent context, and the agent does not read it to orient ([`acceptance-tests.md`](./acceptance-tests.md)). An index nothing checks is an index that rots, and a table that has quietly started
lying is worse than no table.
