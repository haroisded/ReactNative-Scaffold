# Frontend

React Native Paper = one source of truth for UI. Its theme (`src/themes.js`) holds colour, type,
corners, spacing. Phones + tablets, iOS + Android. No web.

Replaces `layout.md`, `typography.md`, `visual-language.md`.

## Rules

**Paper**

1. Every primitive = Paper component, imported from `@/components/<name>`. Never from
   `react-native-paper` (lint). Never `Text` from `react-native`.
2. Native exceptions, only these: `Pressable` (press targets), `NativeTabs` (`(tabs)` bar only),
   native `formSheet` (narrow confirms and pickers).
3. Customizing a Paper component is fine when needed: `style`, `contentStyle`, `labelStyle`,
   `titleStyle`, per-component `theme` prop, compositions. Every value still comes from the theme.
   Never re-implement a primitive Paper has.
4. Composition lives in its screen folder. Moves to `src/components/` when a second screen needs it.

**Theme values**

5. Colour = theme key, read through `useAppTheme()`. No literals (lint). Missing colour → new key
   in both themes + row in §2.
6. Type = `Text` with a `variant`. Never `fontSize`, `lineHeight`, `fontWeight`, `letterSpacing`,
   `fontFamily`, `textTransform`, `fontVariant` at call site. Need different type on a Paper
   component → spread a variant (`labelStyle={theme.fonts.titleSmall}`), never numbers.
7. Corners = `roundness` (Paper) or `radius.sm/md/lg/xl` + `borderCurve: 'continuous'` (hand-drawn).
   No radius number at call site. Avatars stay circular.
8. Spacing = step of `spacing`. `gap` between siblings, `padding` inside container. No sibling
   margins.
9. Accent only where §2.3 lists. Destructive = `error`, never `accent`.

**Type**

10. Same variants on phone and tablet. Never scale type by width, height, `PixelRatio`, device. No
    scaling libs (`react-native-size-matters`, `moderateScale`, responsive-fontsize).
11. Floor 11 (`labelSmall`, meta only). Readable content ≥ 14, secondary ≥ 12. Max weight 700.
12. Never `allowFontScaling={false}`. Font-scale caps live in the `Text` wrapper per variant (§3.2),
    never at call site. Body text never capped.
13. New variant = decision. Add to `src/themes.js` + §3.1 row, same pass.

**Layout**

14. One width threshold, `WIDE_MIN`. Source: `useWindowDimensions().width`, read once (§4.1).
    Screens read `useShellWide()`. No `isTablet`, device check, second breakpoint, tablet-only screen.
15. Column counts and pane sizes: container `onLayout` (`useColumns`). Never `Dimensions.get()`.
16. Wide container: grid cards → more columns. Row cards → second pane or `DataTable`. Never a wider
    row.
17. No fixed card width or height. Image → `aspectRatio`. Text → `numberOfLines`. Anything holding
    text → `minHeight`, never `height`.
18. Left-aligned everywhere: headings, copy, full-width button labels. Only floating surfaces
    (`Dialog`) are centred, plus two recorded exceptions: the sign-in column (nothing beside it to
    align with) and the Create System card's contents (one target, not reading). Running prose →
    `maxWidth`, no `alignSelf`.
19. Touch target ≥ 48 Android, ≥ 44 iOS.

**Code**

20. Icons: name from `ICONS` (`src/lib/icons.tsx`), both `{ ios, android }` halves, verified before
    use.
21. Static styles → `StyleSheet.create` at bottom of file. Inline only for render-time values
    (measured width, theme colour).
22. Doc silent → follow nearest existing screen, add the row here same pass.
23. Skill contradicts this file → this file wins (§8). New contradiction → new row, never quiet
    code change.

---

## 1. Where values live

Doc names keys and purposes. Code holds values. Differ → code wins, fix doc same pass.

| What | File |
| --- | --- |
| Colour keys, type scale, `roundness`, `spacing`, `radius` | `src/themes.js` |
| `useAppTheme()` — typed Merchant colour keys | `src/lib/theme.ts` |
| `WIDE_MIN`, rail / drawer / pane widths, `useColumns`, `ShellWideContext`, `useShellWide()` | `src/lib/columns.ts` |
| `ICONS` map, `renderIcon` | `src/lib/icons.tsx` |
| Paper re-exports, `Text` wrapper, shared compositions | `src/components/` |

Both themes need every key — separate objects.

## 2. Colour

### 2.1 MD3 keys in use

| Key | For |
| --- | --- |
| `primary` | header + rail ground, primary buttons, selected segment, detail-card header strip |
| `onPrimary` | text + icons on `primary` |
| `onSurface` | body text, names, amounts, 2px structural rules |
| `surface` / `background` | screen + pane ground |
| `secondary` | secondary labels, unselected segment text, column headers |
| `outlineVariant` | field borders, 1px rules between blocks |
| `surfaceVariant` | thumbnail placeholders, tag fills, hairlines between rows, bulk action bar |
| `error` / `onError` | Void, Delete, destructive kickers, Low / Expiring / Expired badges |
| `errorContainer` / `onErrorContainer` | "hard delete blocked" callout |
| `backdrop` | dialog + sheet scrim |

### 2.2 Merchant keys (added)

| Key | For |
| --- | --- |
| `accent` / `onAccent` | §2.3 only |
| `onSurfaceMuted` | hints, SKUs, sub-lines, Draft status |
| `onSurfaceFaint` | placeholders, Inactive status, Empty pack |
| `surfaceMuted` | selected row, active form section, type badge fill, note callout ground |
| `surfaceSubtle` | toolbars, receipt pane |
| `primaryHighlight` | active rail / drawer item; ripple on `primary` |
| `ripple` | `Pressable` `android_ripple` on light surface |

Paper types `theme.colors` to MD3 only → read added keys through `useAppTheme()`.

### 2.3 Accent — only here

- Register tile on Home (the one filled tile). The + circle on the systems list's Create System card
- Active rail / drawer item: 4px bar. Active form section row: 3px bar
- Kickers
- Inline text actions: "Auto-generate", "Scan", "+ Add …", "+ New …", "Clear all"
- Toggle on. Stepper progress bar
- Note callout left rule. Cart count badge
- Pack: Open status, remaining bar, **Next pick** badge (`accent` fill, `onAccent` text)

Everything else: ink on white.

### 2.4 Status

| Status | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| Active, Sealed | `onSurface` |
| Draft | `onSurfaceMuted` |
| Inactive, Empty | `onSurfaceFaint` |
| Open (pack) | `accent` |
| Low, Expiring, Expired (lot), Void | `error` |

## 3. Typography

System font. No typeface loaded. One `configureFonts` call in `src/themes.js`, shared by both themes.

### 3.1 Scale

Mirror of `fonts` in `src/themes.js`. Change one → change both, same pass.

| Variant | For | Size / line | Weight | Tracking | Cap | iOS ramp |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `displaySmall` | one hero line per screen: Home greeting, paid figure | 32 / 40 | 700 | 0 | 1.5 | `largeTitle` |
| `headlineMedium` | screen title, name in detail header | 26 / 32 | 700 | 0 | 1.5 | `title1` |
| `headlineSmall` | heading inside screen, Home tiles, dialog + sheet title | 22 / 28 | 700 | 0 | 1.5 | `title2` |
| `titleLarge` | Appbar title — Paper picks it, never type it. MD3's app-bar size (was 18/24 to 2026-10-04) | 22 / 28 | 600 | 0 | 1.5 | `title3` |
| `amount` (custom) | money figure that is the point of its block; tabular digits | 20 / 26 | 700 | 0 | 1.5 | `title3` |
| `titleMedium` | list-row name, product name, rail brand line | 16 / 22 | 600 | 0.1 | 1.5 | `headline` |
| `titleSmall` | dense row name, open folder in breadcrumb | 14 / 20 | 600 | 0.1 | 1.5 | `subheadline` |
| `bodyLarge` | `TextInput` value — Paper picks it; long prose | 16 / 24 | 400 | 0.15 | none | `body` |
| `bodyMedium` | default body: field values, descriptions | 14 / 20 | 400 | 0.25 | none | `body` |
| `bodySmall` | secondary: SKU, hints, sub-lines, timestamps | 12 / 16 | 400 | 0.4 | none | `footnote` |
| `labelLarge` | rail + drawer labels; `Button`, `Chip` pick it | 14 / 20 | 600 | 0.1 | 1.5 | `subheadline` |
| `labelMedium` | kickers, field labels, column headers, badges, status tags — **uppercase** | 12 / 16 | 600 | 0.5 | 1.5 | `caption1` |
| `labelSmall` | floor: non-essential meta only | 11 / 16 | 500 | 0.5 | 1.5 | `caption2` |

- `displayLarge`, `displayMedium`, `headlineLarge`: Paper default, unused. Never type them.
- `labelMedium` carries `textTransform: 'uppercase'` in token. Write copy in normal case.
- `amount` carries `fontVariant: ['tabular-nums']` in token → digits align in columns.
- MD3 key in `configureFonts` merges over default: name only what changes. Custom key (`amount`)
  carries every property, `fontFamily` included.
- Line height ≥ 1.2 × size, always (§7).

### 3.2 `Text` wrapper

`src/components/text.tsx`. Call site passes `variant` only. Wrapper adds, per variant:

- `maxFontSizeMultiplier` — Cap column
- `dynamicTypeRamp` (iOS) — ramp column, so large text grows like native styles
- typing for `amount`

Cap logic: read content (body) uncapped. Scanned content (row names, labels) + hero text 1.5.

Paper components drawing own label (`Button`, `Chip`, `TextInput`) take their own
`maxFontSizeMultiplier` prop. Leave default unless layout breaks.

### 3.3 Variants Paper picks itself

| Component | Variant | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Button`, `Chip` | `labelLarge` | nothing |
| `Dialog.Title` | `headlineSmall` | nothing |
| `Appbar.Content` | `titleLarge` | nothing |
| `TextInput` value | `bodyLarge` (unverified vs 5.15.3 source) | nothing |
| `Card.Title` | `bodyLarge` / `bodyMedium` — body type on a heading | pass `titleVariant="titleMedium"` |
| `List.Item` | none — raw `fontSize` from own stylesheet | `titleStyle` / `descriptionStyle` from `theme.fonts`, or build row from `Text` |

Override allowed when needed (rule 3) — spread a variant, never numbers (rule 6).

### 3.4 Phone vs tablet

Type does not respond to width. Reading distance barely changes phone → handheld tablet.

Responds to width instead: anatomy, column count, gutters, visible table columns (§4).

Tablet text too wide → `maxWidth` on the container, target 40–60 characters per line. Never bigger
type.

### 3.5 Surviving large font scale

OS setting scales `fontSize` + `lineHeight`. Layout must hold at 200%.

- No fixed height on anything holding text
- `flexShrink: 1` on text inside a row
- `numberOfLines` only where full text is reachable (detail view). Never truncate errors, prices,
  field labels
- Wide table unreadable at large scale → narrow anatomy for that list: `useTableFits()`
  (`src/lib/columns.ts`) = wide and OS font scale ≤ 1.15. Table-vs-cards only; dialog-vs-sheet stays on
  `useShellWide()`
- Width holding a label (rail, Register tile) → `fontScaled(width)`, grows to the 1.5 cap. Layout, not
  type (rule 10)
- Human tests at Android 200% and iOS largest size, phone + tablet

## 4. Layout

### 4.1 Wide or narrow

- `wide = useWindowDimensions().width >= WIDE_MIN`
- Read once in `src/app/(app)/_layout.tsx` → `ShellWideContext` → shell, `(tabs)`, `forms/`,
  `sheets/` and screens call `useShellWide()`. Not lower: `forms/` + `sheets/` sit outside the
  merchant shell
- `(tabs)` bar hidden when wide: same threshold
- Window, not container: sync, no zero-width first frame, follows rotation + split-screen
- Screens never call `useWindowDimensions` for width

### 4.2 Columns

```
columns = max(1, floor(containerWidth / minCardWidth))
```

`useColumns(minWidth)` → `{ columns, onLayout }`. Container measured, not window: a pane beside the
rail is narrower than the window.

| List | Do |
| --- | --- |
| `FlatList` | `numColumns={columns}` + `key={columns}`. `columnWrapperStyle` gap. Items `flexBasis: 100/columns %`, not `flex: 1` |
| `FlashList` 2.x | gutter on the cell, half each side, same half off container padding. No `columnWrapperStyle`, no `estimatedItemSize`. `key={columns}` as insurance |

`FlashList` for long lists. `FlatList` for small bounded lists.

### 4.3 Cards

| Kind | Example | Wide container |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grid card | Register item tile, Home tile, system card | more columns |
| Row card | Assets / Inventory row, receipt line, pack row | second pane or `DataTable` |

| Part | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Image | fix ratio on wrapper `View` (`aspectRatio`), never pixel height. Placeholder in a grid card: 16:9 |
| Text | `numberOfLines` 2 on name, 1 on SKU |
| Card | no `height`. Siblings stretch to tallest |
| Controls | fixed size allowed: stepper button, toggle, thumbnail, touch target |

### 4.4 Wide / narrow pairs

| Where | Narrow | Wide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell | drawer, off-canvas | rail, permanent, collapsible to icons |
| Assets, Inventory lists | card list | `DataTable` + bulk select |
| Item opened from list | own route | detail pane beside list |
| Product + Inventory item forms | stepper: "Step n of N", Next, progress bar | section list beside field grid |
| Register | Items / Cart tabs, payment at foot of Cart | items pane + cart side by side |
| Confirms, pickers, Filters panel | native `formSheet` route | Paper `Dialog` |
| Small create/edit forms (category, subcategory, supplier, tax class), Profile | full-page route | Paper `Dialog` over the screen it was opened from: the same route as a `transparentModal` (`DIALOG_ROUTES`, `src/app/(app)/_layout.tsx`) |
| Receipt wizard | stepper, Review as the last step | stepper left, Review sidebar right |
| Systems list | Create button + row cards | grid, Create System card first |

Same at both widths: the product and Inventory item forms, stock movement and create-system (full
page), multi-step flows (full-screen route).

Rejected for the small forms on a tablet (2026-10-04, the human's call): a full page — a 560dp
column on a 1180dp window, and centring it is §9's banned centred column; inline Dialog mounts in each
opener, the shape before a2b3259 — seven openers and two return paths; a side sheet. The Dialog route
keeps one opener push and `sheet-result.ts`. Its keyboard: `KeyboardAvoidingView` around the route plus
the Dialog's `maxHeight`, since the edge-to-edge Android window does not resize.

All pairs flip together → one decision (§4.1).

### 4.5 Spacing

`spacing.xs … xxl` from `src/themes.js`, 4-point scale.

- Screen edge padding: one step, same on every screen. Narrow vs wide may differ one step
- `ScrollView` padding through `contentContainerStyle`
- Negative margin only to cancel a Paper built-in inset. Say so in a comment
- Fixed-size controls are sizes, not spacing

### 4.6 Images

`expo-image`, `contentFit="cover"`, inside `View` with `aspectRatio`.

- Request displayed size from Supabase Storage (`transform`). Bucket the width, never exact card
  width — CDN cache
- Transforms depend on Supabase plan. Without them: thumbnail at upload, store both paths
- Postgres stores storage path, never URL

### 4.7 On a wide container

| Changes | Stays |
| --- | --- |
| Anatomy (§4.4) | Type scale |
| Column count | Radius, border width, elevation |
| Gutters + padding, one step | Icon sizes |
| List → list + detail | Touch target minimum |
| Visible table columns | Image aspect ratios |
| Form grid: two columns or one | Left alignment |

## 5. Patterns

Paper piece per pattern. File named → use it, do not build a second.

Press targets: `Pressable` + `android_ripple={{ color: colors.ripple }}` every time
(`primaryHighlight` on `primary`).

### Structure

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| 2px rule: under page header, above totals, between Home sections | `View`, `height: 2`, `onSurface` |
| 1px rule | between blocks `outlineVariant`; between list rows `surfaceVariant` |
| Page header | `src/components/page-header.tsx`: `labelMedium` kicker in `accent`, `headlineMedium` title, `bodySmall` count, contained `Button`, 2px rule. Actions beside title wide, own row under it narrow |
| Section heading | `headlineSmall` + `bodySmall` hint on same baseline |
| Full-width button | Paper centres label → `contentStyle` with `justifyContent: 'flex-start'` |
| Button width | narrow: full width, label left. Wide: content width (`alignSelf: 'flex-start'`), several in a wrapping row. Never a full-width button across a tablet |
| Pane switch (`SegmentedButtons`) | narrow: full width, own row under the page header. Wide: in the page header's actions beside the add button, `width: fontScaled(PANE_SWITCH)` — segments are `flex: 1` and do not measure labels, so content width collapses them to 76dp |

### Shell

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| Header | `Appbar.Header` on `primary`: menu `Appbar.Action`, `Appbar.Content`, bell + account actions |
| Rail / drawer | expo-router `Drawer`, `drawerType` `'permanent'` wide, `'front'` narrow. `drawerStyle` zeroes the hairline border, front-drawer corners `radius.xl`. Rail square + flush |
| Rail / drawer item | `Pressable`: `Icon` + `labelLarge`. Active: `primaryHighlight` ground, 4px `accent` bar left |
| Group row (Store, Resources) | opens / closes its screens, not a destination |
| Collapse to icons | menu action toggles `RAIL_EXPANDED` / `RAIL_COLLAPSED` |
| `(tabs)` bar | `NativeTabs`. Colours passed as props from `useAppTheme()` — `PaperProvider` does not reach native views. Icons: `{ sf, md }` halves of the map |
| System badge | `Avatar.Text` on `onPrimary` |

### Lists

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| Wide list | `DataTable`: `src/components/header-title.tsx` per column (label string, `textStyle` = `labelMedium`, start-aligned), `Checkbox.Android` bulk column, `IconButton` row actions |
| Narrow list | `FlashList` rows: thumbnail, `titleMedium` name, badge, `bodySmall` meta, amount right-aligned |
| Bulk action bar | `surfaceVariant` strip: clear `IconButton`, count in `labelLarge`, text `Button`s, Delete in `error` |
| Search | outlined dense `TextInput` + `TextInput.Icon` |
| Filter + sort | wide: one toolbar row — Search, outlined `Button` "Filters · n", Sort `Button` anchoring `Menu`. Narrow: Search on its own row, the two buttons under it. Active filters: `Chip`s with `x`, then `accent` text `Button` "Clear all" |
| Filters panel | `src/components/list-filters-dialog.tsx`. Selects, `SegmentedButtons` (2–4 options), toggles. Applies as changed: Done, no Apply |
| Folder row + breadcrumb | `src/components/folder-nav.tsx`. Each folder = push of the list route, Back climbs one |
| Pack row, lot drill | `src/components/pack-row.tsx`, `lot-drill.tsx` |
| Stock badges (Low, Expiring, Expired) | `src/components/product-badges.tsx`: `labelMedium` in `error` |
| Type badge | `View`, 1px `outlineVariant` border, `surfaceMuted`, `labelMedium` |
| Thumbnail placeholder | `View` on `surfaceVariant` + `Icon`. Real image: `expo-image` |

### Forms

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| Section list (wide) / stepper (narrow) | `src/components/section-stepper.tsx`, `step-header.tsx`. Optional step: "· Optional" + text `Button` "Skip tier" |
| Field label | `labelMedium` above control. Required: label ends ` (required)`. Optional: no marker. Hint `bodySmall` right |
| Text field | outlined dense `TextInput`, no floating `label`. `left` / `right` affixes for currency + units |
| Select | `src/components/menu-select.tsx`: non-editable outlined `TextInput` anchoring `Menu` |
| Inline-create select | Select + last `Menu.Item` "+ New …" in `accent`. Created row comes back selected |
| Date / time field | Select shape + `calendar` / `clock` icon → `DateTimePicker` (`@expo/ui/community/datetime-picker`). iOS: inline picker in dialog, Done |
| Segmented field, type selector | `SegmentedButtons`. Wrap two per row narrow |
| Toggle | Paper `Switch`, on colour `accent`, sentence in `bodyMedium` beside |
| Tags, date list | `Chip`s with `x` in wrapping row, then text `Button` "+ add …". Remove label on `closeIconAccessibilityLabel` |
| Repeatable rows | rows + remove `IconButton`, then `accent` text `Button` "+ Add …" |
| Weekly hours | seven rows, 1px `surfaceVariant` between: `Switch`, `titleMedium` day, time fields. Closed in `onSurfaceFaint` |
| Variant matrix row | one 1px `outlineVariant` box per combination: `labelLarge` label, SKU, barcode, price difference, quantity |
| Note callout | `src/components/note-callout.tsx`: 3px left border `accent` or `error`, `surfaceMuted`, `bodySmall` |
| Footer | `src/components/form-footer.tsx`: outlined Save as Draft + contained Publish. Pinned bottom narrow |
| Line under buttons | `mutationNotice(...)` (`src/lib/errors.ts`) |

### Detail and dialogs

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| Detail header | thumbnail, `headlineMedium` name, type badge, status badge, `amount` price, Archive + Edit `Button`s |
| Detail card | `Card mode="outlined"`. Header strip: `View` on `primary`, `labelMedium` in `onPrimary`. Rows: `bodySmall` key, `bodyMedium` value |
| Confirm or picker | `src/components/adaptive-dialog.tsx`. Wide: `Portal` + `Dialog` with `maxWidth`. Narrow: route in `src/app/(app)/sheets/`, `presentation: 'formSheet'`, `sheetAllowedDetents: 'fitToContents'`, `sheetCornerRadius: radius.xl`. Opener decides |
| Sheet body | OS owns frame + scrim → content carries theme: 2px `primary` top rule, kicker, title, actions padded above gesture bar |
| Destructive confirm | `src/components/confirm-dialog.tsx`: Cancel, red confirm, notice under body. Kicker in `error` |
| Unsaved changes | `src/components/discard-dialog.tsx` + `src/lib/unsaved-guard.ts`. Stays a Paper bottom sheet narrow |
| Create / edit form | route in `src/app/(app)/forms/`: a full page narrow; wide, a Dialog for the small forms (`AdaptiveDialog asPage wide`, §4.4) and a full page for stock movement. Created row returns through `src/Store/sheet-result.ts` |
| Multi-step flow | full-screen pushed route, every width |
| Request in flight | `Dialog` `dismissable={false}`, full-page form back blocked. Sheet: `gestureEnabled` off, Android back swallowed |
| Loading / error / retry | `src/components/query-state.tsx` |

### Register

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| Item tiles | grid, columns from `useColumns(TILE_MIN)` |
| Quantity stepper | two `IconButton`s around `titleMedium` count, 1px `outlineVariant` border |
| Totals | `bodyMedium` rows, 1px rule, `amount` grand total |
| Complete Sale | contained full-width `Button`, label left, amount right |
| Items / Cart (narrow) | `SegmentedButtons` on top, cart count in `accent` badge, payment at foot of Cart tab — never a sheet |

### Home

| Pattern | Build |
| --- | --- |
| Greeting | `labelMedium` kicker, `displaySmall` greeting, `bodySmall` date |
| Destination tiles | grid of `Pressable` cells split by 2px `onSurface` rules: `Icon`, `headlineSmall` name, `bodySmall` description. Register cell filled `accent`. Columns from `useColumns` |
| Systems list, wide | `headlineMedium` "Your POS Systems", `bodyLarge` line. Grid from `useColumns(SYSTEM_CARD)` (3 across 1180dp). First cell `src/screens/home/create-system-card.tsx`: `Pressable`, 1px dashed `outlineVariant`, `surfaceMuted`, `radius.lg`, centred `accent` + circle, `titleMedium` name, `bodySmall` line; always there, so it is also the empty state. Narrow keeps the Create button |

## 6. Icons

`SymbolView` from `expo-symbols`: SF Symbols iOS, Material Symbols Android.

- App code passes map names (`edit`, `delete`, `close`, `add`) to Paper's `icon` / `source`. Never a
  set's own name
- New icon → add `{ ios, android }` pair to `ICONS`, verify, then use
- Paper renders through `PaperProvider` `settings.icon` → `renderIcon` → pair + `color` as
  `tintColor`
- Unmapped name → MaterialCommunityIcons fallback, on purpose: Paper's internal names (`menu-down`,
  `check`), brand marks (`google`, `facebook`)
- SF Symbol missing → substitute recorded in `ICONS`
- `NativeTabs` takes the same pair as `sf` + `md`

## 7. What broke

Symptom → cause → rule. Entry stays while the stack that caused it stays. Prune on Paper / SDK bump.

| Symptom | Cause | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grid card image wrong height | `Card.Cover` hardcodes height | `expo-image` in `aspectRatio` `View`. `Card.Cover` only in single-column detail |
| Doubled padding in card | `Card.Content` pads itself | no own padding inside it |
| Dialog stretches across tablet | `Dialog` has no max width | always `maxWidth` + centred |
| Card collapses with `flexGrow` | Paper `Surface` flex check ignored `flexGrow` | `patches/react-native-paper+5.15.3.patch`. Prefer `flex: 1` on card items |
| Every variant resized | `configureFonts` treats all-non-object config as flat | always key by variant |
| List row ignores type scale | `List.Item` reads raw `fontSize` | §3.3 |
| Icons blank boxes | Paper default icons need `react-native-vector-icons` fonts, none loaded | `renderIcon` through `PaperProvider` `settings` |
| Icon blank on Android, no warning | Material Symbols name missing from font | verify pair in `ICONS` first |
| Icon blank first frame, cold start, Android | symbol font loads async | accepted |
| Icon clipped at large font scale, Android | expo-symbols draws the glyph as a font-scaled `Text` in a fixed box | `renderIcon` asks for size ÷ font scale, box held at size |
| Press invisible on Android | `Pressable` reads no theme | `android_ripple` every time |
| Native view wrong colour | `PaperProvider` does not reach native views | pass colours as props |
| `theme.colors.accent` type error | Paper types colours to MD3 | `useAppTheme()` |
| `FlatList` throws on rotate / resize | `numColumns` changed, same `key` | `key={columns}` |
| No gutter between `FlashList` cells | 2.x positions cells absolutely, flex `gap` reaches nothing | gutter on cell |
| App crash, Android tab bar | native tabs cap at five | shell = `Drawer`, not `NativeTabs` |
| `Menu` lands offset in sheet | `Menu` positions from window coords, sheet is partial height | flows holding a `Menu` = full-screen route |
| Sheet with nested stack fails, Android | Android `formSheet` cannot host a nested stack | sheets = leaf routes of `(app)` Stack |
| Keyboard covers sheet's save buttons | sheet + keyboard | create / edit forms = full page |
| Required `*` ignored by testers | read as decoration | ` (required)` in label |
| Filters wrapped to three lines on phone | filters spread across toolbar + chip rows | Filters panel |
| Group headers lost while scrolling | collapsible headers in long list | folders as route pushes |
| Glyphs clipped on Android | line height ≤ font size distributes unevenly (RN #29507) | line height ≥ 1.2 × size |
| Extra line wrap on Android | `lineHeight` + `letterSpacing` + `maxFontSizeMultiplier` together (RN #46436) | watch `labelMedium`; report, do not hack per call site |
| Bold renders regular on Android | system font: numeric weights unreliable, no 800 | max 700 |
| Font-scale user gets double inflation | width-scaled font + OS scale stack | rule 10 |
| Title squeezed to a few letters per line beside its buttons, narrow | `flexWrap` row: Yoga shrinks the flexible child instead of wrapping | pick the anatomy from `useShellWide()`, not `flexWrap` (page header, list toolbar) |
| Table column titles centred over left-aligned cells | `DataTable.Title` is a row; a cell style's `justifyContent: 'center'` centres it horizontally | `header-title.tsx` forces `flex-start` |
| Rail labels missing, icons only | `flex: 1` label row in a column item has zero basis → zero height | `flexGrow`, not `flex: 1`, under the rail icon |
| Register tile name broken mid-word at large font scale | fixed tile min width, growing name | `fontScaled(TILE_MIN)` |
| Rail labels truncated at large font scale ("Resour…") | fixed rail width, growing label | `fontScaled(RAIL_EXPANDED)` |
| Grid card mostly empty grey on tablet | square placeholder at 1/4 of 1180dp | 16:9 placeholder |
| `Card.Title` blank at content width | its title is `flex: 1`: zero basis in a hugging card | content-width action → `Button`, not `Card` |
| Tablet ignores `orientation: portrait` | Android 16, `targetSdk` 36: `screenOrientation` ignored at smallest width ≥ 600dp | accepted. Phones stay portrait, tablets rotate; layout follows the window (§4.1) |
| Small form squeezed into the left half of a tablet | full-page route, its 560dp column left-aligned | small forms = Dialog over the screen wide (§4.4) |
| Lone half field stretched across its row | `flexGrow` on a half `Field` with no partner beside it | `FieldGrid` caps a half at one column (measured, `HalfWidthContext`) |
| Crash when the window widens past `WIDE_MIN` | a hook called after `wide &&`, so the hook order changed | call every hook unconditionally (`useTableFits`) |
| "Invalid prop `compact` supplied to `React.Fragment`" | `Dialog.Actions` clones `compact` onto each child, and the child was the caller's Fragment | `AdaptiveDialog` lays out its own actions row |

## 9. Not used

No custom primitives. No `src/styles/`. No loaded typeface. No in-app text-size control. No width-based
type. No `isTablet`, device classes, second threshold, tablet-only screens. No centred content column
(sign-in excepted, rule 18).
No fixed card heights. No `react-responsive`. No per-screen colour picking. No hand-shaped avatars —
`Avatar.Text label=""`.

## 10. Unverified

Code matches the doc; these need a human on a device. Delete a line once checked.

- Weight 500 (`labelSmall`) renders on Android system font. 600 checked 2026-10-03, emulator. Not → 700
- Tablet split-screen proper. Checked 2026-10-03 only by resizing the emulator window (`wm size`) below `WIDE_MIN`: rail → drawer flips live
- iOS icon names: machine is Windows, checked against `sf-symbols-typescript` types only
- iOS ramp column §3.1: mapping is a guess
- Status badge in detail header: `onSurface` text on `primary` ground = same colour in light theme
