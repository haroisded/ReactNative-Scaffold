// Subscribed at module scope, like the AppState listener in supabase.ts: one listener that should
// live as long as the app, so there is nothing to unsubscribe. Importing this module is what
// starts it. (Fast Refresh re-evaluating the file can register a duplicate in development; both
// write the same value, so it is a dev-only wart.)
//
// This one subscription is the only source of truth — no getSession() alongside it that could
// disagree. INITIAL_SESSION (restored from AsyncStorage) is emitted only after
// `await this.initializePromise` (GoTrueClient.js:3627,3635), so it lands a tick later rather than
// during this call. That gap is exactly what `undefined` names.
//
// The event is discarded on purpose: all six carry the current session, and the session alone
// decides what renders. Branching on the name would add states, not information.
//
// The callback stays synchronous. Not for the reason every tutorial gives — there is no auth lock
// to deadlock on unless you opt into the deprecated one — but because _notifyAllSubscribers awaits
// every callback in one Promise.all (GoTrueClient.js:4326-4334), so a slow one stalls the rest.
