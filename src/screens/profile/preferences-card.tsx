 *
 * Its own file rather than inline in index.tsx: the screen is already the longest in `src/screens/`
 * and `node tools/fallow-verdict.mjs` fails it on complexity. A block with no props and no state of
 * its own is the cheapest thing to lift out (.claude/instruction_mds/structure.md §6 — it stays in the
 * screen's folder until a second screen wants it).
