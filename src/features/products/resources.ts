 *   Products    flat services                     — a delivery fee, an installation
 *   Rentables   rental assets, bookable services  — a bike, a meeting room
 *   Inventory   stock and consumables             — a shelf item, a kitchen ingredient
 *
 * `scope` is a column on both products and product_categories, written by the database from the
 * product's type, so a Rentables product cannot point at an Inventory category. This file is the
 * client's half of the same fact, and the only place the three screens differ: the list, the form, the
 * detail and Setup are one implementation each, parameterised by what is below (instruction_mds/structure.md §3).
