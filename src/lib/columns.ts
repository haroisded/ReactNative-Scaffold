 * split-screen the window is not what the list received. `Dimensions.get()` at module scope is
 * worse — a snapshot taken at import time that never updates, not on rotation, resize, or fold.
 *
 * First frame reports width 0, so `columns` is 1 until layout runs. A wide container therefore
 * shows the narrow presentation for exactly one frame. The flip is monotonic, so there is no
 * thrash; if you ever see one, something is measuring the window instead of the container.
