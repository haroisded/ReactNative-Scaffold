// (react-native-screens types.d.ts:470). The route files are in ./sheets/.
//
// This list must name every file in ./sheets/, and nothing else. Both halves fail silently: a name
// with no file is ignored, and a file with no name here still routes — as an ordinary full-screen
// push with no sheet presentation and no contentStyle, which is how delete-product shipped as a

// - `(tabs)` owns the merchant-level bottom navigation — the systems list and the Account tab.
// - `systems/[id]` sits outside it, so opening a system PUSHES over the tab bar rather than becoming
//   a fifth tab. It is the merchant shell: a header plus a rail or drawer of its own.
// - `create-system` is the create form, pushed full screen over the systems list at every width.
// - `sheets/*` are the native sheets above.
