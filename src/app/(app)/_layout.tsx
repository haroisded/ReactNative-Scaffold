// Declared here, as leaf routes of this stack, because an Android formSheet cannot host a nested
// stack (react-native-screens types.d.ts:470) — and one set then serves Home, Profile and every stack
// under the shell. The route files are in ./sheets/.
//
// This list must name every file in ./sheets/, and nothing else. Both halves fail silently: a name
// with no file is ignored, and a file with no name here still routes — as an ordinary full-screen
// push with no sheet presentation and no contentStyle, which is how delete-product shipped as a
// top-aligned white screen (tests/test-report/resources-test-report.md, Test 7).

// The root layout declares <Stack.Screen name="(app)" />, and that group needs its own layout to
// render into. This is the seam where further signed-in routes get added without touching the guard.
//
// Children, and the split matters:
// - `(tabs)` owns the merchant-level bottom navigation — the systems list and the Account tab.
// - `systems/[id]` sits outside it, so opening a system PUSHES over the tab bar rather than becoming
//   a fifth tab. It is the merchant shell: a header plus a rail or drawer of its own.
// - `profile` is Profile opened from inside a system. It is pushed over the shell so back returns to
//   the same system; the Account tab cannot do that from here (see profile.tsx).
// - `create-system` is the create wizard, pushed full screen over Home at every width.
// - `forms/*` are the create/edit forms (category, supplier, tax class, stock movement): full pages at
//   every width, so an ordinary push with no options.
// - `sheets/*` are the native sheets above.
